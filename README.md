# ICBoost

This repository contains python and R implementation of the algorithms proposed in ICBoost.

## Description

This study introduces a survival algorithm that integrates regression trees and ensembles for interval-censored data (ICBoost). Due to the interval-censored characteristics of the data, accurate prediction of survival is challenging. Therefore, in this paperï¼Œ an unbiased transformation method that utilizes kernel density estimation is proposed to impute the failure time and predict survival.

## Data

The data used in this research are collected from R package bayesSurv and ADNIMERGE.


## The describe of the program

The program is divided into three sections saved in this repository.

1) untrans.R: an r code for some basic unbiased transformation functions.

2) XGBt.py: a python code for training the XGBoost model with grid search method.

3) Main.R: The code is used to reproduce the prediction results.
